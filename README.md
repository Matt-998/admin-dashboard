This is my Admin Dashboard project where i used CSS grid a whole lot. I had already used it a bit previously but this was more of a deep dive.
I still found myself reaching for flexbox a fair bit but in time i'm sure i will get more used to grid.

I am certainly no creative designer so i followed the sample image pretty closely.
